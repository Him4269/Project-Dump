# Universal Mod

This is a simple Universal GUI for *most* unity games, I say most because I havent tested all of them.

Note: This is a **MelonLoader** Mod because ML is the most Universal patcher.

## Installation

You need to download MelonLoader for this to work

First:
- Download **MelonLoader.exe** at [this link](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases)
- Run the exe and click the **Select** Button
- Find the path to the Unity game's exe
- Under Version select *latest*, and under Game Arch select *Auto-Detect*
- Simple Click install
- Then drag the .dll into the **Mods** folder in the Unity Game's Directory
